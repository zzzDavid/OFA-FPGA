# A Guide to deploy Once-For-All networks on Xilinx DPU

## Introduction
This documentation is a detailed guide to quantize, compile, deploy, and measure latency of Once-For-All networks on Xilinx ZCU102 board running DPU. The models that are successfully deployed on Xilinx DPU are listed in the following table. 

| Model | Top-1 Accuracy | FLOPs | #Param | Latency |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------|
| Proxyless-Mobile 0.5|  |    |   |     |   |
